# Breakdance Custom Elements for Oxygen Users

A set of elements for Breakdance, which will make the work of Oxygen users more pleasant. Not recommended for Elementor fans.

It is supplied "as is" and can be used in your projects now, while you should understand the possible risks, since Element Studio is still in the Alpha stage.
You can fork it and modify it however you want.

## The set currently contains: ##

### Image Pro ###

- Simplified settings. Less fun options
- Less html output
- Added aspect ratio setting
- Width, Height and Aspect Ratio settings shown to the main tab. Less clicks as you like
- Added option "Use as background in parent container" (for use inside a div or full-width section)

### Div Pro ###

- Full layout control in one section. More control, less clicks
- Added min-width and height
- Full control of margin and padding in the Spacing section

### Next?... ###

Maybe I'll add something else if I have ideas
